# Language Models 

The repository contains implementation of 
1. DAN: [Deep Averaging Network](https://aclanthology.org/P15-1162.pdf) for text classification
2. RNN: Forward and backprop of RNN with custom computational graph 
3. BERT: Encoder-only Transformer with custom self-attention 
4. DPR: [Dense Passage Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) with BERT-based query & doc encoders
5. Beam-search: Beam search for autoregressive inference 
6. ToT: State model for [Tree-of-Thought]() reasoning
